  <p>We are a non-profit organization helping the less fortunate through community donations.</p>
  <p>Every day, countless animals are abandoned, left to fend for themselves on the streets—hungry, injured, and scared. Some are puppies and kittens discarded in alleys, others are loyal pets whose owners could no longer care for them, and many are injured wildlife struggling to survive. These animals don’t have a voice, but together, we can be their hope.</p>
